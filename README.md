# Digital Store

## Introduction

My neighbor once asked me to build a website for his digital device business. Here it is.
The main function of this website is for introducing his company and displaying his product.
I don't think he will ever hire a programmer to maintain his little site, so I try to make it
more adaptable by allowing user to change basically everything in this site without editing its
code.

You can read [here](http://enoblog.herokuapp.com/articles/9) to know more about it.

## What you can do with this site

1. For introducing something, maybe a city, a park, your company or your collections
2. You can use it as a blog.
